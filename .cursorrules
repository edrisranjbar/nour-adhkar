# Cursor AI Rules for Nour Adhkar Project

## Flutter Commands
- **NEVER** run `flutter run` automatically after making changes
- **NEVER** run `flutter clean` automatically
- **NEVER** run `flutter pub get` automatically unless explicitly requested
- Only suggest these commands to the user, let them decide when to run them

## When Making Changes
- Make file edits and fixes
- Check for linter errors with `read_lints` tool
- Inform the user about the changes made
- Suggest running `flutter run` if needed, but DON'T execute it
- Let the user control when to restart the app

## Exceptions
- The user explicitly asks to run Flutter commands
- The user says "run the app" or similar direct instruction
- Package dependencies are added (then only suggest `flutter pub get`)

## General Guidelines
- Focus on code quality and correctness
- Use the linter to validate changes
- Provide clear explanations of what was changed
- Be efficient with tool usage
